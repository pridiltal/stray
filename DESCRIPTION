Description:
    This is a modification of 'HDoutliers' package. The 'HDoutliers' algorithm is a powerful 
    unsupervised algorithm for detecting anomalies in high-dimensional data, with a 
    strong theoretical foundation. However, it suffers from some limitations that 
    significantly hinder its performance level, under certain circumstances. This package 
    implements the algorithm proposed in Talagala, Hyndman and Smith-Miles (2019) 
    <arXiv:1908.04000>  for detecting anomalies in high-dimensional data
    that addresses these limitations of 'HDoutliers' algorithm. We define an anomaly as an observation that deviates markedly from the majority
    with a large distance gap. An approach based on extreme value theory is used 
    for the anomalous threshold calculation.
